### Hey y'all!
I'm a *Senior Customer Success Manager* at **GitHub**, based in 🌧️ Seattle 🌦️ and obsessed with 📢 languages, 🐕 dogs, and 🎮 the Legend of Zelda. After getting my start in the gaming industry at Nintendo and then Xbox, I hopped on the DevOps train and spent several years helping folks learn and build things with Chef and Jenkins.
